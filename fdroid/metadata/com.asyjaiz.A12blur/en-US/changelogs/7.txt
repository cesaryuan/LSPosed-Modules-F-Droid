## Introducing to you: Translucent Shade with a GUI app!
Now the QS area is customizable too! There may be not as many features as you've expected, but some are still planned.

### Upon activating the GUI version untick and tick SystemUI in LSPosed. It's important!
### Additional note: the compatibility of the GUI app with Android 15 might be broken because of the LSPosed again. Keep that in mind.
I know it sounds dumb, but there's some kind of preferences bug, and sadly on Android 15 they won't work at all. We'll have to wait for an official fix.
It might work on your device, but it didn't on mine. Try it out.

### Changes
- "Rebranding"
