- StatusbarClock: respect time zone changes when showing seconds
- StatusbarClock: keep master switch for Clock tweaks off by default (thanks to aviraxp)

*IMPORTANT:* Module settings are reset when framework is upgraded from EdXposed v0.4/OG Xposed to EdXposed v0.5.1+/LSPosed
due to changes in preferences storage location for modules in EdXposed v0.5/LSPosed
It is recommended to create a backup of GravityBox settings before upgrading the framework.
