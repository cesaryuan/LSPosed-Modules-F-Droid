    <h3>Steps to use:</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Install Magisk, <a href="https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPosed">LSPosed</a> Or <a href="https://github.com/ElderDrivers/EdXposed">EdXposed</a>.</li>
    <li>Install the apk of this app (available from <a href="https://github.com/BaltiApps/Pixelify-Google-Photos/releases">Releases</a> page.)</li>
    <li>Open LSPosed / EdXposed app and enable the module. For LSPosed, Google Photos will be automatically selected.</li>
    <li>Reboot. Enjoy. (If needed, you might need to clear data of Google Photos app).</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>How does this module work?</h3>
    <p>It simply hooks on to <code>hasSystemFeature()</code> method under <code>android.app.ApplicationPackageManager</code> class.
    Then when Google Photos checks the relevant features which are expected only on Pixel devices, the module passes <code>true</code>.
    Thus Google Photos enables Pixel-Exclusive features.<br />
    The features being “spoofed” can be found from:<br />
    <a href="https://github.com/DotOS/android_vendor_dot/blob/55f1c26bb6dbb1175d96cf538ae113618caf7d06/prebuilt/common/etc/pixel_2016_exclusive.xml">Dot OS sources</a><br />
    <a href="https://github.com/ayush5harma/PixelFeatureDrops/tree/master/system/etc/sysconfig">PixelFeatureDrops magisk module</a><br />
    This module can also spoof some of the <code>build.prop</code> information like <code>BRAND</code>, <code>MANUFACTURER</code>, <code>MODEL</code>, <code>FINGERPRINT</code> of some Pixel devices.</p>
