    <h2>Introducing to you: Translucent Shade with a GUI app!</h2>
    <p>Now the QS area is customizable too! There may be not as many features as you've expected, but some are still planned.</p>
    <h3>Upon activating the GUI version untick and tick SystemUI in LSPosed. It's important!</h3>
    <h3>Additional note: the compatibility of the GUI app with Android 15 might be broken because of the LSPosed again. Keep that in mind.</h3>
    <p>I know it sounds dumb, but there's some kind of preferences bug, and sadly on Android 15 they won't work at all. We'll have to wait for an official fix.<br>
    It might work on your device, but it didn't on mine. Try it out.</p>
