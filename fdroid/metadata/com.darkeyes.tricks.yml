    <p>There is a simple user interface that can be launched through Xposed Manager to choose what mods that you want. A reboot is needed every time you change a setting for version 2.31 and older. Starting with version 3.0, all settings can be applied at runtime (except for Show 4G and Hide LTE+/4G+ which still require a reboot).</p>
