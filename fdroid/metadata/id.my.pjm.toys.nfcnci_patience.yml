    <h1>NfcNci Patience</h1>
    <p>Add a delay (1000ms by default) to the NFC presence check to accommodate longer NFC smart card operations in AOSP NfcNci implementation on certain devices (see <a href="https://gitlab.com/LineageOS/issues/android/-/issues/7268">LineageOS issue #7268</a>)</p>
    <p>This bug —which may sound obscure at first, plagues several apps e.g. the German eID app and most of Indonesian electronic pass (Mandiri e-money, BCA Flazz, etc) recharge apps (failure upon balance update) due to those apps not having sufficient <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/nfc/NfcAdapter#EXTRA_READER_PRESENCE_CHECK_DELAY"><code>EXTRA_READER_PRESENCE_CHECK_DELAY</code></a> value, which results in the NFC service’s assumption that the smart card has been lost.</p>
    <h2>Setup</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Install this module</li>
    <li>Enable this module and ensure that “Nfc Service” (the <code>com.android.nfc</code> package) is added to the scope</li>
    <li>Reboot the device for the module to take effect</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Configuration</h2>
    <p>You can use the provided settings interface to tune the presence check timeout to your needs, provided that they’re a whole number ranging from 125 to 5000. You do <em>not</em> need to reboot your device for the change to take effect.</p>
