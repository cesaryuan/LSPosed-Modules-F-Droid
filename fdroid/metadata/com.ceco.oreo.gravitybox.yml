    <p><em>IMPORTANT:</em> Module settings are reset when framework is upgraded from EdXposed v0.4/OG Xposed to EdXposed v0.5.1+/LSPosed<br>
    due to changes in preferences storage location for modules in EdXposed v0.5/LSPosed<br>
    It is recommended to create a backup of GravityBox settings before upgrading the framework.</p>
