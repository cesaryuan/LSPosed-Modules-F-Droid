CurrentVersion: 1.0.5
CurrentVersionCode: 6
Description: |-
    <p>This is a re-release of CaptureSposed v1.0.4, which was itself a re-release of CaptureSposed v1.0.3. The reason for this is because Google's app review team incorrectly flagged the v1.0.4 Play Store release as failing to install properly. Despite the numerous evidence presented in our appeal, the release was blocked and we were therefore required to release yet another version. To maintain consistency of releases across all of the module's distribution channels, a new build has been made available here as well.</p>
    <p>Release notes for CaptureSposed v1.0.3: This release reduces the amount of storage space used by the module and improves the module's performance.</p>
