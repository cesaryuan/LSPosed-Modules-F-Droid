    <h1>Sensible Android Auto:Xposed</h1>
    <p>Xposed module for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.projection.gearhead">Android Auto</a> app to make the interface restrictions configurable</p>
    <p>Because Android Auto is integrated into certain vehicles, Google either felt the need to, or regulations required that they build in some driver distraction protections into Android Auto.
    Unfortunately, some of these restrictions just add to driver frustration, and prompt one to disconnect the phone from AA and fiddle with it directly. This too is a distraction, and one
    that I believe outweighs the inability to scroll lists while in motion.</p>
    <p>This module should bypass most of these restrictions. In its current state, there is a cosmetic issue on some built-in AA units where the warning speed bump still shows, but the underlying
    list is still scrollable. Still working on trying to make this speed bump disappear.</p>
    <p>As a reminder, I’m not responsible for anything that happens as a result of using this module. If you’re not capable of doing more than one task at a time while driving, I <em>HIGHLY</em> suggest
    you not install this module.</p>
