    <h1>no-accessibility-services</h1>
    <p>An Xposed module that disables apps from getting installed and enabled accessibility services.</p>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>Out of the blue, many banking and wallet apps in my country started forcing users to disable Accessiblity Services for all apps using it for security’s sake (!?). So if you’re using some Launcher that makes use of Accessibility to turn of screen with a gesture, you’re fucked. If you’re using some kind of tools to control your devices from PC (e.g. Samsung Link to Windows), you’re fucked. If you’re using Button Mapper to customize your hardware buttons, you’re also fucked.</p>
    <p>Or you can get your devices rooted, Xposed, load this module and fuck them back.</p>
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Install</li>
    <li>Activate</li>
    <li>Select apps (System Framework may need to be selected too)</li>
    <li>(Force stop those apps)</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It’s only been tested on LSPosed (v1.8.6 - Zygisk). Refer to <a href="https://fankes.github.io/YukiHookAPI/en/guide/home.html#suppored-hook-framework">Supported Hook Framework</a> to see if it works on your end.</p>
