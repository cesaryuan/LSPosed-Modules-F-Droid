- Android 13 support (xposed)
- Android 13 support (targetSdk)

**Note**
This is the last update for this fork. The update contains fixes for xposed crashes on Android 13.
The update **does not contain** new hooks for modern ways of existing features, so they may not work on some applications.
The application fully uses the original hooks with support for new OS versions. Many applications use new methods added by Google later.

If anyone is interested, you can continue to develop new hooks methods.
