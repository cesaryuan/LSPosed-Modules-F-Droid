    <blockquote>
    <p><strong>warning</strong>
    Usually avoid using the Content Provider plugin. It works only with host apps targeting sdk version 30 or lower. Because of the middle bridge, power consumption is higher. Moreover, future updates coming to Motion Emulator may not be implemented for this plug-in.</p>
    </blockquote>
