    <h1>Disable Target API Block</h1>
    <p>On Android 14, Google started blocking old apps (those targeting a target API lower than 23, i.e.
    anything before Marshmallow/Android 6) from being installed.</p>
    <p>While this behaviour can be overridden by calling <code>adb install</code> (respectively <code>pm install</code> if
    you’ve got access to a root shell on your device) with the <code>--bypass-low-target-sdk-block</code> flag, it
    still breaks simple manual installation of older APKs, as well as any backup apps and other software
    like that which hasn’t yet been updated for this new behaviour.</p>
    <p>This Xposed module hooks the app installation process to always behave as if that flag had been
    passed and to therefore generally allow installation of old apps.</p>
    <h2>Compatibility</h2>
    <p>Requires at least Android 14.</p>
